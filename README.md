## Overview

SimpleSave is a save & load system for Unity
The goal is to make a very simple static system usable everywhere in your code with custom classes and more!
The design philosophy of this system is to be as simple as possible but allow great customization.

## Roadmap

- [x] Allow the use of custom classes
- [x] Allow the creation of extensions for non-serializable objects
- [x] Save and load to binary
- [ ] Save and load to JSON
